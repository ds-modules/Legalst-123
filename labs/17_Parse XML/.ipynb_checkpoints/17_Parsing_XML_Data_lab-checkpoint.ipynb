For this lab, we'll go through the trials from 1754-1756. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) provides a hierarchical representation of data contained within different tags and nodes. We'll go over XML syntax later. We will learn how to parse through these XML files from Old Bailey and grab information from sections of an XML file.\n",

    "First we will go through how to parse one XML file. The Old Bailey API has a total of **197751** cases. Fortunately, we are only going to use the ones from 1754-1756, but that still only narrows the number of cases to somewhere above 1300! \n",

The `requests` library gets (`.get`!) you a response object from a web server and will automatically decode the content from the server, from which you can use `.json()` to see the document! Requests through the Old Bailey API will return a dictionary, embedded in which is the XML representation of the trial account, which we can then write as a file and save.\n",

Unfortunately, the data now come in a format that is more complicated that the earlier format, so we will have to do some work to extract all the trials we want over the two year period (1754-1756) that we want to look at. The `total:` key below tells us that there are a total of 1312 trial records in the period 1754-1756. The numbering scheme for the `idkey:` also tells us something about the organization of the records; the prefix `f` is for front matter, while `t` is for trial account. After that is the date with digits for year, month, and day, followed by a hyphen with how many accounts are in the series for that day. Note that many trials occurred on a day when the Old Bailey was in session."
