    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we will spend some time looking into different classification algorithms from the ones you have seen in previous labs so far. To aid us in our prediction tasks, we will also be learning about how to effectively use feature selection to make sure we are optimizing our use of the data. For this purpose we'll be utilizing the Nashville police stops dataset that you have seen in several labs thus far.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Prediction Algorithms**: \n",
    "    - We will cover a handful of other classification algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, random forests, and naive Bayes. For each algorithm, we'll provide some intuition behind which circumstances they are most useful for and how to judge their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "    - We will learn about the process of feature selection, which will allow us to optimize our model and reduce overfitting of our model, which we learned about in the previous lab."
