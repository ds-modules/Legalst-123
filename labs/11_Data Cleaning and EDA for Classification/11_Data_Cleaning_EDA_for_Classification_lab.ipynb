    "*    Data is deduplicated on raw columns stop_date_time, stop_location_street, officer_employee_number, race, sex, and age_of_suspect, reducing the number of records by ~0.3%\n",
    "*    There are 30 (of ~2.6M records) cases where search_conducted is ambiguous after the merge and are left as NA, since it's unclear whether they are true or false, since being NA after the above merge indicates that there were two distinct values for raw column searchoccur\n",
    "*    reason_for_stop and violation are both translations of the original stop_type column; this column is sometimes the pretextual reason for the stop and does not always represent what the individual was ultimately cited for\n",
    "*    contraband_drugs is raw column drugs_seized, contraband_weapons is weapons_seized, and contraband_found is evidenceseized\n",
    "*    citation_issued is derived from traffic_citation_issued and misd_state_citation_issued, which are passed through as raw_*; misd_state_citation_issued is sometimes NA, so for the purposes of defining citation_issued, we consider NA to be false\n",
    "*    warning_issued is derived from verbal_warning_issued and written_warning_issued, which are passed through as raw_*; written_warning_issued is sometimes NA, so for the purposes of defining warning_issued, we consider NA to be false\n",
    "*    search_basis is based on the raw columns search_plain_view, search_consent, search_incident_to_arrest, search_warrant, and search_inventory, which are all passed on with the raw_* prefix\n",
    "*    subject_race is derived from raw columns suspect_ethnicity and suspect_race, which are passed through with the raw_* prefix\n",
    "*    search_person is derived from search_driver and search_passenger, which are passed through with the raw_* prefix\n",
    "*    When contraband_found is NA, we fill it with false when a search occurred, under the assumption that the officer simply didn't record the absence of contraband\n"

    "We covered data cleaning and missing values in Labs 3-6, so this is just a brief review. The sample of cleaned data that we are using in this lab already has dichotomous (dummy) variables that indicate subject race, subject sex, and type of violation that resulted in the stop, but if you look closely the dataset retains the original variables--I think it is always a good idea not to throw away information if possible. In this section we will get rid of the existing dummy variables and create new ones and decide on what to do with missing values in the process of readying data for predictive models (which we will create in Labs 12-14."

    "#### Changing Unit of Analysis to Individual Nashville PD Officers\n",
    "Instead of using Nashville as our unit of analysis, we can examine searches by individual officers to see if we can better understand any patterns in the data. Our unit of observation remains individual stops. Here we will first make a table of the top 10 officers in terms of searches over the time period in the dataset and aggregate each column in the data in a way that makes sense. After that, we will try mapping the stops resulting in searches by particular officers. _This would look more interesting if we used all the data in the dataset rather than just our sample, because searches are an unusual outcome._\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make a table of searches by officer, for the top 10 officers in descending order by number of searches, aggregating each feature in a meaningful way. For example, you would want to aggregate `'subject_age'` as a mean, rather than a sum, but for other features you may want to report both a sum and a mean (which for dichotomous variables is a proportion, remember). You should only use features that are summable (i.e., dichotomous features are fine, categorical ones are not).\n",
    "* Hint 1: the sample data is not so voluminous so you can make a new dataframe with the columns you select\n",
    "* Hint 2: when you aggregate by officer, you can pass [.agg a dictionary](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.agg.html#pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.agg) telling it what to do with each column\n",
    "* Hint 3: you can sort the table by `'search_conducted'` and [the aggregation function index label 'sum'](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html#pandas.DataFrame.sort_values) thusly `by=('search_conducted','sum')` since Pandas sees that now as a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "The last bit of code in the cell renders the table and displays it nicely in the notebook. Note that the means and sums are just for the searches by officer caught in our sample of 2000."

    "The last point is often talked about in Machine Learning as \"data leakage.\" The basic idea is that you cannot use a predictor that requires you to know already the value of the outcome. There are a few of these in the Nashville police stop dataset if we are trying to train a model that predicts when a stop results in a search. "
