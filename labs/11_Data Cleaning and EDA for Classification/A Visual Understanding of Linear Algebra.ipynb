Or, in python syntax, if `B == np.hstack(v_1, v_2, v_3)`, then `A @ B == np.hstack(A @ v_1, A @ v_2, A @ v_3)`.\n",

The matrix product `A @ B` stores up both a transformation by `B` and a transformation by `A` in one matrix. When we use matrices, we mostly won't be thinking of them as transformations, but they can be used as such. So if `A` represents a rotation by 30 degrees, and `B` a horizontal stretching, then `A @ B` is a matrix which stretches horizontally and then rotates 30 degrees."
