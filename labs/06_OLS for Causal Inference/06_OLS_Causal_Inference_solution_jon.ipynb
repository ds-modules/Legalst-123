    "In the social sciences, regression is often used to support a causal argument based in some kind of theory of human action. In effect, what it represents mathematically is \"what is the effect of a unit change in $x$ (the cause of interest) on $y$ (the outcome of interest), holding everything else equal.\" Another way of thinking about it is as the partial correlation between a single variable $x$ and an outcome $y$. Correlation and regression are introduced quite well in the Adhikari and DeNero text, so here we are trying to show how social scientists use regression to make causal arguments.

Income may or may improve access to high quality information but it is usually important in conditioning a person's knowledge about the world, so we will include it, and we will include gender since it is also an important facet of identity that can affect views toward the political world."

    "Here's a little review of what we already talked about, applied to the interpretation of regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in conducting a hypothesis test is to answer the question, \"Was it likely to observe my test statistic due to chance?\" We say something is statistically significant if it is sufficiently far enough away from the center of an empirical distribution, and therefore unlikely to have occurred just by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic way to frame a hypothesis test is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a null $(H_O)$ and alternative $(H_A)$ hypothesis. The null hypothesis is usually framed as \"no statistical relationship between the observed data and the background distribution\" and the alternative hypothesis is the opposite. More concretely, the null is our default position, and assumes that the observed statistic likely came from the background distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate a test statistic (for example, t-test, $\\chi^2$, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check if the test statistic is far enough away from the center of the distribution. Traditionally, this was done by checking against a reference table, but in Python, we'll use p-values. Typically, a p value of less than .05 (meaning that only 5% of observations should fall where the test statistic does) is used as the threshold for statistical significance in the social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are talking about interpreting regression models, we are mainly interested in the coefficients for each of the important causal variables we have identified (using induction or perhaps theory as it has developed in the social sciences) and whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero at some confidence level. Usually the social sciences settles on the 95% confidence interval; in other words, assuming that our estimate is correct, in repeated sampling from the underlying population we would get an estimate within the confidence interval 95 times out of 100. If zero is not in the interval, then we can say we have found an effect. Sort of arbitrary but at least it provides a standard of confidence."

    "**The model, first of all, does not account for much of variance in the dependent variable 'post_vaccine'--the measure of fit (R-squared or coefficient of determination) is not very good even by political science standards. But some of our causal measures have an effect: being a Republican tends to reduce how much voters support vaccination in schools by 0.2 points on the seven-point scale; being male also reduces support but by half that amount. Education has the expected effect of more information generating more support for vaccination, despite the antivaxxers. Being white (perhaps because of the inequality of medical care in the US), being older, and earning more all seem to be positively associated with supporting vaccination. **"
